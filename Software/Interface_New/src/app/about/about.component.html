      <h1>“With the IoT, we’re headed to a world where things aren’t liable to break catastrophically – or at least we’ll have a hell of a heads’ up. We’re headed to a world where our doors unlock when they sense us nearby.” – Scott Weiss</h1>
      <p class="about">The official private repository for the HackMe electroencephalogram (EEG) wave project includes all applicable hardware and software files. The HackMe project is an application of brain computer interface (BCI) technology designed for consumer appeal. Wearing an EEG headset concealed with a stylish beanie or other headwear, the consumer’s brain waves are processed and the signal features extracted and classified to indicate a certain mood or a conscious thought as a command. Recent research on BCI technology heavily focuses on medical applications such as prosthetic limbs and disorders of the nervous system. The HackMe product, however, is designed for ease of everyday life and is subsequently beneficial to those who rely on BCI for medical purposes as an increase of BCI products on the market will lower competitor costs. The clean, cost efficient design of HackMe relies on signal processing, feature extraction, feature classification, Internet of Things (IoT) and User Interface (UI).<br/><br/>
        After amplification and processing, the brain signals must be filtered through processes involving feature extraction. The three filters considered in the HackMe proof of concept are the Poisson distribution, the spike triggered average (STA), and the phase locking value (PLV). Both the Poisson distribution and STA model information contained in spike trains. A spike train is a series of instantaneous, identical impulses in which each spike can be represented mathematically by the delta function. The Poisson distribution is the simplest model for describing the location and sequence of spikes in a spike train and involves determining the probability that a certain event will occur in a given time period. The STA computes the average value of the stimulus preceding a spike. The PLV takes signals from two different EEG electrodes and measures the similarity of their phases.<br/><br/>
        Feature extraction using Poisson, STA, and PLV filters raw data into numerical arrays symbolizing a pattern of conscious thought and underlying, continuous mood. Once the raw data has been filtered using several methods to individually characterize each spike in the signal as much as possible, the data is sent through a classifier to distinguish one thought from the next and develop the continuous mood. The classifier works by training a large set of data with known characteristics. Each data point is assigned a value of 1 or -1, depending on the known outcome (the previously determined mood or thought). Once the classification algorithm learns on a large set of data, another sample set is sent to the machine for testing. The machine will classify this testing set based on its previous trainings and will output a boolean two element array, 1 symbolizing the presence of a thought and thus a command and 0 symbolizing that no command will take place. The machine also outputs a string describing the mood based on the most common frequency of brain wave detected.
